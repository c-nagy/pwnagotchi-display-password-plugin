# Pwnagotchi display-password.py Plugin

Displays the most recent cracked password on the Pwnagotchi display. It currently processes the wpa-sec potfile generated by the Pwnagotchi wpa-sec.py plugin. Support for OnlineHashCrack is a goal. Feel free to help out if you want.

# Installation

1. SSH into your Pwnagotchi and create a new folder for third-party Pwnagotchi plugins. I use `/root/custom_plugins/` but it doesn't really matter: `mkdir /root/custom_plugins/`
1. Grab the `display-password.py` and `display-password.toml` file from this Github repo and put it into that custom plugins directory.
1. Edit `/etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml` and change the `main.custom_plugins` variable to point to the custom plugins directory you just created: `main.custom_plugins = "/root/custom_plugins/"`
1. In the same `/etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml` file, add the following lines to enable the plugin:
```
main.plugins.display-password.enabled = true
main.plugins.display-password.orientation = "horizontal"
```
Once the above steps are completed, reboot the Pwnagotchi to ensure all changes are applied.
